<h1 class="title">Preferences over lotteries and the independence axiom</h1>


<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Using the independence axiom to deduce preferences</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
This program can be used to deduce preferences over lotteries from preferences over other lotteries. This is done using the independence axiom directly. It can also generate simple exercises where you can try to solve this problem yourself by hand.
</p>

<p>
The question we ask first is the following: If we have a certain set of preference relations, say an individual prefers lottery \(L1\) over \(L1'\), can we deduce that he prefers lottery another \(L\) over \(L'\)? We use the example we had in the lecture where we have three states and $$L1 = [0.1,0.8,0.1]\succ[0.0,1.0,0.0]=L1'.$$ Now we want to know whether we can conclude that \(L=[0.55,0.4,0.05]\) is preferred to \(L'=[0.5,0.5,0.0]\). The answer is yes because (i) by the independence axiom $$0.5*L1+0.5*[1,0,0]\succ 0.5*L1'+0.5*[1,0,0]$$ and (ii) this is equivalent to \(L\succ L'\) as \(0.5*L1+0.5*[1,0,0]=L\) and \(0.5*L1'+0.5*[1,0,0]=L'\).
</p>

<p>
How can we solve such an exercise in general? To solve the example we had to find the lottery \([1,0,0]\) and the weight \(0.5\). If we know that \(L1\succ L1'\) and we want to conclude that \(L\succ L'\), we have to find a lottery \([x_1,x_2,x_3]\) and a weight \(x_0\) such that
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>$$x_0 L1 + (1-x_0) [x_1,x_2,x_3] = L$$
</li>
<li>$$x_0 L1' +(1-x_0)[x_1,x_2,x_3]=L'.$$
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If we can find such \(x_0\) and \([x_1,x_2,x_3]\), then we can conclude by the independence axiom that \(L\succ L'\). Note that the two equations above consist actually of three equations each. Take the first one and let us denote \(L1\) as \([a,b,c]\) and \(L\) by \([d,e,f]\). Then the first equation could also be written as
</p>

<p>
$$x_0\left(\begin{matrix}a\\b\\c\end{matrix}\right) +(1-x_0)\left(\begin{matrix}x_1\\x_2\\x_3\end{matrix}\right)=\left(\begin{matrix}d\\e\\f\end{matrix}\right)$$
which are of course three equations
</p>

<p>
$$x_0a+(1-x_0)x_1=d$$
$$x_0b+(1-x_0)x_2=e$$
$$x_0c+(1-x_0)x_3=f.$$
</p>

<p>
The second condition is, of course, similar. Hence, we have six equations but only four unknowns: \([x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3]\). This alone means that there is a good chance that there is no solution. What makes the situation even trickier is that our solution has to satisfy a few conditions. Since \([x_1,x_2,x_3]\) is a lottery, all three variables have to be between 0 and 1 (they are probabilities!) and they have to sum to 1. Furthermore, \(x_0\) is also a probabiltiy and has, therefore, to be between 0 and 1. So we get the additional constraints
$$0\leq x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3\leq 1\qquad x_1+x_2+x_3=1.$$
If this system of equations and inequality constraints has no solution, then we do not know whether the agent prefers lottery \(L\) over \(L'\).

<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Using the PC to solve such exercises</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The program below uses the "system of non-linear equation" solver from the openopt package to (try to) solve exactly the problem we just described. We try to find a solution \(x=[x[0],x[1],x[2],x[3]]\) of the six equations described above. The solution has to satisfy the constraint \(x[1]+x[2]+x[3]=1\) which written in below in matrix notation \(Ax=beq\) where \(A=[0,1,1,1]\) and \(beq=1\). To make sure that we have probabilities, we have a lower bound of \(lb=[0,0,0,0]\) and an upper bound of \(ub=[1,1,1,1]\). These bounds are generated with a loop. This has the advantage that you can use the program also if you have lotteries with more than three states. After this we create a function \(g\) which plugs a given \(x\) into the six equations (it subtracts the right hand side from the left hand side of each of these six equations and returns the differences). If for some feasible \(x\) \(g\) returns zero, then we are done: We have found a solution! If there is no such solution, then we are also done: We do not know whether \(L\) is \(L'\) are preferred. Hence, we ask the non-linear equation solver to try to find a solution \(x\) such that \(g\) is zero.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
If we have more information, that is if we know several preference relations, we are more likely to be able to make a prediction. If we know that \(L1_1\succ L1_1'\) and \(L1_2\succ L1_2'\) and if we can find weights \(x_0\), \(x_1\) as well as a lottery \([x_2,x_3,x_4]\) (I stick to three states for now) such that 
$$x_0 L1_1+x_1 L1_2+(1-x_0-x_1)[x_2,x_3,x_4]=L$$ 
and at the same time 
$$x_0 L1_1'+x_1 L1_2'+(1-x_0-x_1)[x_2,x_3,x_4]=L'$$
then we can conlude by the independence axiom that \(L\succ L'\). Note that we still have six equations but we have one additional variable to satisfy these six equations! If we knew even more preference relations we would get more and more variables while the number of equations stays the same. This is the mathematical equivalent to saying that we are more likely to be able to draw a conclusion if we have more information.

The program below extends the previous one by allowing whole lists of known preference relations. It then determines whether we can say that the agent prefers lottery \(L\) to \(L'\).
