A correlated equilibrium is eventually nothing but a probability distribution $f$ over action profiles. Which conditions does $f$ has to satisfy to be a correlated equilibrium? If an action profile in which player $i$ plays $a_i$ is in the support of $f$, then $i$ must find it optimal to play $a_i$ whenever it is "recommended" to him, i.e. 

$$\sum_{a_{-i}\in A_{-i}} u_i(a_i,a_{-i}) \frac{f(a_i,a_{-i})}{\sum_{a_{-i}\in A_{-i}}f(a_i,a_{-i})}\geq \sum_{a_{-i}\in A_{-i}} u_i(a_i',a_{-i}) \frac{f(a_i,a_{-i})}{\sum_{a_{-i}\in A_{-i}}f(a_i,a_{-i})}\qquad\text{for all } a_i'\in A_i$$

where $\frac{f(a_i,a_{-i})}{\sum_{a_{-i}\in A_{-i}}f(a_i,a_{-i})}$ is the conditional  probability of $(a_i,a_{-i})$ given that $a_i$ was "recommended". Multiplying the expression above through by $\sum_{a_{-i}\in A_{-i}}f(a_i,a_{-i})$ yields

$$\sum_{a_{-i}\in A_{-i}} u_i(a_i,a_{-i}) f(a_i,a_{-i}) \geq \sum_{a_{-i}\in A_{-i}} u_i(a_i',a_{-i}) f(a_i,a_{-i})\qquad\text{for all } a_i'\in A_i$$
 
for any $a_i$ in the support of $f$. This inequality can also be written as 

$$\sum_{a_{-i}\in A_{-i}} (u_i(a_i,a_{-i})-u_i(a_i',a_{-i})) f(a_i,a_{-i}) \geq 0\qquad\text{for all } a_i'\in A_i.$$

This inequality is linear in $f$. Note that this inequality also holds for $a_i$ that are not in the support of $f$ (as $f(a_i,a_{-i})$ will then be zero). We can therefore conclude that a correlated equilibrium is characterized by a system of linear inequalities: one set of inequalities as above for each action of each player. Any solution $f$ of this system of inequalities that also satisfies the regularity conditions (recall that $f$ is a probability distribution!)
$$f(a)\geq 0\quad\text{for all }a\in A\qquad\text{and}\qquad \sum_{a\in A}f(a)=1$$
is a correlated equilibrium. Note that there is usually a whole range of correlated equilibria: The set of solutions to a number of linear inequality constraints is convex. This means that we have a continuum of solutions whenever there are two distinct solutions. Also note that as the number of players and/or actions increases, the number of inequalities increases relatively quickly.

However, systems of linear inequalities can be  solved relatively easily numerically and this is what we do below. We will use the simple example game:

  ##TO DO: funnily, the solver cannot solve games in which each player has a unique rationalizable action
  ## and returns an error there.
  ##This could be easily fixed by handing the game to the rationalizability solver in the "except" statement below.

  #the game is read in
  # format: first we keep the action of P2 fixed and vary P1's action
  # hence, we write the columns of the game table as lists
  # for 3 players: holding P3's action fixed we have a two player game as below;
  #simply enter a list of these two player games (one for each action of P3);
  #for more players: proceed as going from 2 to 3
  game = [[(0,0),(1,5)],[(5,1),(4,4)]]
  #example game with three actions per player
  #game = [[(0,0),(1,1),(1,1)],[(1,1),(0,0),(1,1)],[(1,1),(1,1),(0,0)]] 
  #example game with three players (see MSZ example 8.2)
  #game = [[[(0,1,3),(1,1,1)],[(0,0,0),(1,0,0)]],[[(2,2,2),(2,2,0)],[(0,0,0),(2,2,2)]],[[(0,1,0),(1,1,1)],[(0,0,0),(1,0,3)]]]
  ##example game with only one rationalizable action per player (currently cannot be solved)
  #game = [[(3,2),(1,1)],[(2,1),(1,3)]]
  ##matching pennies example: there is a unique correlated equilibrium
  #game = [[(1,-1),(-1,1)],[(-1,1),(1,-1)]]

  #Ulist is list of payoff tuples (for 2 player games, we move column by column):
  #-first tuple is when every player uses his first action
